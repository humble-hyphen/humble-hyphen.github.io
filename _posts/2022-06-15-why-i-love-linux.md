## What is Linux?

Linux is an Operating System, like Windows and macOS. Linux holds a share of 2.7% of all the operating systems.

An operating system is responsible for coordinating tasks between

-   system hardware (CPU, RAM, etc)
-   Input/Output devices (Keyboard, mouse, monitor, speakers)
-   Applications (MS Office, Photoshop, Web browser)

I don't need to do something that is not required to do in this

## I don't hate windows

Before I go any further, I don't dislike Windows/Mac OS. (Like I hate Facebook). I use Windows at work, which is the majority of my computer use, and it's a great OS.  I earn a living using Windows. It's a great good OS. But I LOVE Linux more. I believe, when one gets sufficiently educated about the pros and cons of each, they also will.

## Why I love Linux

In summary
1\. Linux is extremely lightweight on system resources. (My Linux OS use only 250MB after a fresh boot, whereas windows use 2.2GB)
2\. Linux is more secure. Less or No viruses
3\. Linux gives me control and choice. I am way more efficient with Linux
4\. Linux respects my privacy and doesn't collect my data
5\. Linux is FREE and Open Source.

## If Linux is that good, why only 2%

1.  Corporates (Windows/Apple) can spend big advertising/Sales money
2.  Windows has the advantage of Critical Mass (having ~80%)
3.  People are lazy
4.  Linux's advantage of choice might overwhelm some

## Who shouldn't use Linux

1.  People who use windows only specialized software as their profession.
2.  Gamers (Unless they are willing to test some tweaks)

## Why believe me

1.  I've been using Linux as my main driver for about ten years
2.  I did Linux system administration as my job for two years

If you are interested to learn more, read on. I am elaborating more on the above points.

## Why I love Linux

Extremely Lightweight on Resources

My personal computer is old, turning ten years next year. It is a 2012 HP Probook 4440s with an HDD hard disk that is almost about to die. (HDDs can be 5-10x slower than nvme hard drives that are in use today), with a Gen2 Intel CPU, with 6 GB RAM. Thanks to Linux, I can do all my resource-hungry tasks such as video editing, photo editing, coding, and virtualizing using my old computer without any performance lags. And when I use windows, I can hardly open multiple excel models in that. The bootup times in Linux are noticeably faster. It doesn't mean Windows is bad. It's just that by its design, Windows OS is very heavy on the system.

While other OS's like Windows/MAC continuously increase the minimum hardware requirement for every new release, with Linux I choose how light or heavy it needs to be depending on my hardware. Linus is the OS of choice for older hardware.

Below is a comparison between my Linux OS and Windows, after a fresh boot (without any user-startup programs). After a fresh restart, my Linux OS consumes 250MB Ram with 44 tasks running, and Windows uses ~9x more RAM at 2.2GBRam with 144 tasks (~3x) running). I use a window manager (instead of a complete desktop environment) with my Linux built. But even with all the bells and whistles, one can manage with less than 1GB.

The tradeoff here is that the higher the OS resource usage, the lesser are the resources available for the user applications(Workprocesser, Browser, Spreadsheet, Text Editor) because OS has the priority.

## Security - Less (No) Viruses

Linux has "less" or "no" viruses. It is due to a few reasons.

-   Linux user share is 3%. There is less incentive for an attacker to focus his exploits on an OS with a lower share. He would rather focus on an operating system with a higher user base, to earn a higher profit.
-   Linux is open source. Since Linux is open-source, vulnerabilities get discovered and patched much faster by the large community around it.
-   Linux is better designed. I am not an expert in this area. But this is one reason the majority of the webservers use Linux. And the way the file access control is designed makes it harder for an attacker to exploit.
-   All Linux software is installed from a central repository. You don't need to download from a shady website on the internet. (Windows is going to copy this with the winget installer)

## Customizability

Be it your workflow, or the visual appearance of the desktop... With Linux, you can customize anything to your heart's content. And once you modify something, it's easily reproducible. You just have to backup your user config folder.

Eg. All my configuration files are synced with a  backup, and with a script, I can quickly bring everything to my setup. It's so easy, I usually reinstall my OS every few months, for the fun of it.

With Linux, I have optimized my workflow to perfection. Hence, I am way more efficient in Linux than in Windows.

I have scripted/automated most of my tasks in Linux using bash. Though Microsoft has its PowerShell, it's not as easy as Linux). I can control all my application windows (not Windows OS) in Linux, entirely with the keyboard, without even touching the mouse. All my frequently done tasks are automated. Web searching is a keystroke away. I can immediately watch a youtube video with a few keystrokes, even without opening the browser. I can even listen to only the audio stream of any youtube video.

Below is an example that I control my work entirely with the keyboard, without even touching the mouse.

Just to show the level of customizability, below is an example where I search for a video and open it in my video player without even opening the browser.

Here I am playing only the audio of any youtube video without opening any program.

## Privacy:

Linux doesn't collect any user data. In contrast, we hardly have any control over Windows/Mac OS. This is one of the things that I hate about windows. In the name of continuous improvement, giving it the fancy name, "telemetry", they monitor, record and analyze every move I make, even after paying for the product.

It's not that I don't trust Microsoft/Apple. It's just a matter of time until they get hacked. Last month over 1.5 Billion user records were hacked and was available for sale. Luckily you and I are not important enough for someone to pay for our data.

## Community and Learning Mindset

Linux has a large community. If you come across an issue, there is a 99% chance that somebody else would have come across this issue and documented it. So you can resolve it yourself. If not, you can ask the question in any of the Linux forums. Also, Linux has helped me in developing a learning-oriented mindset. By using Linux, every day, I learn something new.

## Linux Philosophy

Free: Linux is Free. Windows and macOS aren't. When you buy a computer with Windows/macOS, not only do you pay for the hardware, but also the OS. While the two dominant operating systems (windows - starting USD 119 and MacOs price bundled into hardware). Not only the operating system. Almost all the Linux programs are free too. In the past ten years, I've not come across a task that I couldn't do in Linux with a Free alternative. (Unless it's a specialized commercial software)

Open source: The source code of Linux is Open. Meaning anyone can and see it in <https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git>. In Windows/macOS, even after paying for it, you don't know what happens in there.

# If Linux is that good, why is the market share only 3%

1.  Windows and macOS come pre-installed with hardware
    Windows comes pre-installed with the majority of desktops and laptops. Since it's paid product, Microsoft does its channel development. macOS is exclusively installed in all mac hardware.

    But to get Linux, one should make an effort to install it manually.

2.  Branding/Advertising and partnerships
    Both Windows/Mac OS being commercial entities, they spend millions of dollars on branding and advertising. And also both Windows and Mac OS comes pre-installed in hardware, whereas the user has to install Linux. Especially in the case of windows, they get into partnerships with Laptop manufacturers to have windows pre-installed in the computers. The manufacturer gets part of the revenue as a commission.

    Linux is a non-profit, has neither the money nor the need to increase its userbase. It only has the voice of its users (like me)

2.  Advantages of Critical Mass
    Similar to Viruses, most of the specialized software too focus on OS's with a larger share, as they can address a larger audience. Eg. Adobe creative suite. etc.

    Also, Windows and Apple being commercial entities, want their users to stay with them. Therefore, they create switching costs for the users. Eg. Microsoft Office Suite is not available in Linux. The Office version for Apple is limited in features.

3.  People are Lazy
    People today, value convenience over crucial concepts like privacy, affordability, freedom etc. Most wouldn't bother making the effort to install a new OS when all the other OS's come pre-installed when they buy the computer.

4.  Paradox of Choice
    Linux offers too much control and too many choices to the users. For many, it's a good thing. But for some, it can be a deterrent, if they don't want to take the mental overhead of selection. Eg. Linux has over 500 distributions (versions) in active development. It's free and open-source. So anyone with a computer and sufficient knowledge can spin up a Linux distribution. So people can get overwhelmed and confused. But with a bit of guidance or research, one can easily overcome this. There are enough and more guides on the internet on selecting the right OS.

# When would I not recommend someone to use Linux?

1.  If someone is using specialized software only available in Windows or macOS
    Certain popular software packages are not available for Linux. Very good alternatives are available for most of them. However, if you're using them at a very advanced professional level, I wouldn't recommend you to jump the ship. Eg. If you are a designer and use Adobe creative suite, if you're an analyst and using advanced Microsoft tools such as Excel VBA Coding, Power BI, Tableau etc.

2.  If you're a gamer
    If you're a gamer I would recommend you to stick with windows. Yes. You can get most games to work with Linux with a little bit of tinkering. But why do that, if

3.  If you're too lazy

# Why should someone listen to me?

I've been running Linux as my daily driver on my personal computer since 2011. So it's been 10 years since I started using it.

The first time I came across Linux was in 2004 when I was doing the C programming language module in the university. I used Knoppix live-cd without even knowing what it is. Then in 2008, I started using Linux in servers, when I was a system administrator at a Telecom service provider. and at that point, I got interested in it. In 2007-2008 Ubuntu was delivering CD's via mail for free, I ordered them at that time and used them as a secondary OS. Finally, in 2011, I started using Ubuntu as my main driver.

I've gone through the cycles of awareness, confusion, stabilization and control. I've tried all the main Linux flavours, predominantly using Ubuntu and Mint, until I settled in with Arch Linux in 2019. Even today, I have multiple distros installed on my computer and many as virtual machines, because I Love Linux.

PS: I'd love to help anyone willing to start the journey. So feel free to drop a message if you need help.
